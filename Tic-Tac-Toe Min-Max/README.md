# Tic Tac Toe game

### using MIN MAX algorithm
 
In this project, we will explore how the Minimax algorithm makes decisions in two-player games such as tic-tac-toe.

## Introduction
Imagine playing tic-tac-toe with a friend. Both you and your friend are trying your best to win. For your strategy, you think about what moves your friend might make after each of yours. You try to predict outcomes for each board position to maximize your chances of winning. However, especially in the early game, it's hard to think about all possible moves at once.

Have you ever played tic-tac-toe against a computer opponent instead of a human? How do you think the computer made its decisions?
